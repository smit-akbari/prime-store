How to check installed version of django?

You can check the installed version of Django by using the following methods in your command-line interface:

1. Using the `django-admin` or `django-admin.py` script (replace `django-admin` with `python -m django` if you are using Python 3):

   Open your command-line terminal and run the following command:


   django-admin --version
 

   or

   django-admin.py --version


   This will display the installed Django version.

2. Using the `pip` command:

   You can also check the installed version of Django using `pip`, which is the Python package manager that you likely used to install Django in the first place. Run the following command:

   pip show django

   This will display detailed information about the Django package, including the installed version.

3. Using a Python script:

   If you prefer to check the Django version programmatically within a Python script, you can use the following Python code:


   import django

   print(django.get_version())


   Save this code in a Python file (e.g., `check_django_version.py`) and then run the script using the Python interpreter. It will print the installed Django version.

Any of these methods will provide you with the version number of Django that is currently installed on your system.
